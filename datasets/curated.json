        "patent_abstract": "A graduated multiple collector structure for inverted vertical bipolar transistors, integrated injection logic devices and the like. The invention increases the gain of more distant collectors toward which current flows laterally past intervening collectors from a base contact, and injector or the like. The series resistance drop and the current loss in the base-emitter junction are compensated for by progressively increasing the effective area of collectors further distant from the source of the base current. Although the graduated collector structure is applicable to a wide variety of semiconductor devices, it is particularly well suited for use in oxide-isolated integrated injection logic gates. A mathematical model is provided which can help to optimize designs incorporating the graduated collector structure.",

It is based on the square law characteristics of the MOS transistor and can be realised with only four floating gate MOS transistors, two resistors and a current source. The four floating gate transistors are configured with their sources connected in common and biased by a single current source. Output is taken between two common drain connections. Each transistor has three control gates with two being provided for selected ones of the two input signals and one for a biasing signal (optional). Input signals can be connected to the control gates in either a differential or single ended configuration. In one application, a programmable synaptic cell for neural networks employs the multi-input floating-gate MOS four-quadrant analog multiplier. Varying of the neural weight connection strength of each synaptic cell is achieved by two possible methods. One method involves programming charges into or out of the primary floating-gate of the MFMOS devices associated with the multiplier. The other method is to configure the third input gate of each MFMOS device of the multiplier as another (secondary) floating-gate structure whereby charge can be programmed into or out of this secondary floating-gate structure and its coupling area to the primary floating-gate would determine the neural weight. The differential output current is proportional to the product of the input signal and the programmed charge difference. In a natural extension an array of individually programmable synaptic cells form a neural network.",

A DC link circuit voltage drop across the DC link capacitance of each submodule is controlled to a target voltage by adjusting a duty cycle with a closed-loop control structure having a pilot control and a downstream closed-loop error control. Within the framework of the pilot control, a target value for each duty cycle and a target value for the supply current are determined, using a mathematical model of the converter, based on the load-side output currents flowing out of the DC link voltage circuits and on target values of the DC link circuit voltages. Switch position parameters, which map the effect of the switch positions of the input-side half bridges, are each replaced by an associated duty cycle.",

The invention discloses a uniquely configured optical system which employs polarized sample light passing through a full wave compensation plate, a linear polarizer analyzer and a quarter wave retardation plate for producing vivid color bi-refringence pattern images which uniquely identify high-order refractive indices samples in a diverse population of nearly visually identical samples. The resultant patterns display very subtle differences between species which are frequently indiscernable by conventional microscopy methods. When these images are analyzed with a trainable with a statistical learning model, such as a soft-margin support vector machine with a Gaussian RBF kernel, good discrimination is obtained on a feature set extracted from Gabor wavelet transforms and color distribution angles of each image. By constraining the Gabor center frequencies to be low, the resulting system can attain classification accuracy in excess of 90% for vertically oriented images, and in excess of 80% for randomly oriented images.",

The system and method are particularly suitable for ultra-fine materials having similar color, shape and features which are difficult to identify through conventional chemical, physical, electrical or optical methods due to a lack of distinguishing features. The invention discloses a uniquely configured optical system which employs polarized sample light passing through a full wave compensation plate, a linear polarizer analyzer and a quarter wave retardation plate for producing vivid color bi-refringence pattern images which uniquely identify high-order refractive indices samples in a diverse population of nearly visually identical samples. The resultant patterns display very subtle differences between species which are frequently indiscernable by conventional microscopy methods. When these images are analyzed with a trainable with a statistical learning model, such as a soft-margin support vector machine with a Gaussian RBF kernel, good discrimination is obtained on a feature set extracted from Gabor wavelet transforms and color distribution angles of each image. By constraining the Gabor center frequencies to be low, the resulting system can attain classification accuracy in excess of 90% for vertically oriented images, and in excess of 80% for randomly oriented images.",

This plasma environment provides potential capabilities of military applications of the plasma in the system. Examples of military applications include a stealth system from RADAR and SONAR, a protection system from WMD, and a weapon system to generate and launch plasmoids as a plasma gun. The scope of this invention extends to commercial applications of this plasma shielding system as a conditioned and controlled flow field, for example, a boundary layer and turbulence control system, and a lift control system to improve flight performance and flight economy of aircrafts.

In an embodiment, a plasma reaction chamber forms a plasma in response to input parameters such as gas flow, pressure and power. The chamber includes a window through which the electromagnetic spectrum produced by a plasma in the chamber, just above the subject surface, may be viewed. The spectrum is conducted to an optical spectrometer which measures the intensity of the incoming optical spectrum at different wavelengths. The output of optical spectrometer is provided to an analyzer which produces a plurality of error signals, each indicating whether a respective one of the input parameters to the chamber is to be increased or decreased. The microcontroller provides signals to control respective controls, but these lines are intercepted and first added to the error signals, before being provided to the controls for the chamber. The analyzer can include a neural network and an optional spectrum preprocessor to reduce background noise, as well as a comparator which compares the parameter values predicted by the neural network with a set of desired values provided by the microcontroller.",
